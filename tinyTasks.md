# Tasks – Phase 3 Feature Implementation & Documentation Cleanup

- [x] Make Re-learn work during playback (arm until silence)
  - [x] Latch relearn and start window on first low-confidence segment
  - [x] Disable auto-learn (only relearn window learns) to prevent pulsing noise
- [x] Add low-end protection toggle + clarify Hidden FX impact
  - [x] Add param + UI toggle
  - [x] Wire toggle into denoiser low-end protection
  - [x] Update reset defaults and docs
- [x] Fix low-end bump at max noise reduction + improve static noise learn sensitivity
  - [x] Relax low-frequency protection when speech confidence is low
  - [x] Increase learn gate threshold slightly for static noise
- [x] Move HF/Hidden FX toggles to right column + keep quality meter active when Static Noise enabled
  - [x] Reposition toggles in UI layout
  - [x] Adjust quality meter behavior
- [x] Set Hidden FX bypass to default on
- [x] Add toggles for HF bias and hidden tone FX bypass
  - [x] Add params + UI toggles
  - [x] Wire HF bias toggle into post-noise cleanup
  - [x] Implement hidden tone FX bypass in signal chain
  - [x] Update docs
- [x] Add second-pass noise cleanup (confidence-gated attenuation + fallback)
  - [x] Implement post-noise cleanup DSP module
  - [x] Wire module into signal chain after shaping/recovery
  - [x] Update docs to reflect two-pass denoise flow
- [x] Add tooltip for Re-learn/Static Noise behavior
  - [x] Update UI tooltip text
- [x] Repurpose Learn button to Re-learn + fix noise reduction behavior/low-end bump
  - [x] Inspect UI wiring for learn/clear + slider mapping
  - [x] Update DSP to support Re-learn behavior while playing
  - [x] Investigate low-end bump with noise reduction
  - [x] Update docs/labels if needed
- [x] Implement always-learn noise profile with stability gating + dual profile
  - [x] Review existing NoiseLearnRemove design + call sites
  - [x] Implement dual-profile learner + stability gating
  - [x] Wire config/behavior in processing loop
  - [x] Update docs/comments if behavior changes
- [x] Clean up and sync documentation files
  - [x] Update `CLAUDE.md` (remove protocol duplicates, update version/architecture)
  - [x] Sync `GEMINI.md` with `CLAUDE.md`
  - [x] Sync `QWEN.md` with `CLAUDE.md`
  - [x] Refresh `README.md` to match the current DSP pipeline, macros, and release instructions
  - [x] Update `web/index.html` + `web/help.html` so the website/help page reflect the current mode imagery, version, and feature set
  - [x] Archive or tidy non-core Markdown (`UI_*`, `NEXT_STEPS.md`, etc.) under `docs/archive/` so the root retains only working/project docs
- [ ] Implement Double-Click Reset for UI controls (blocked pending the roadmap that follows documentation cleanup)
-  - [ ] Implement for sliders in `src/ui/components.rs`
-  - [ ] Implement for macro dials in `src/ui/components.rs`
- [ ] Implement Hover Tooltips (Comprehensive) (blocked until UI refinement sprint)
-  - [ ] Verify existing tooltips
-  - [ ] Add missing tooltips to all advanced controls
- [ ] Implement Cursor Changes on hover (blocked until UI refinement sprint)
-  - [ ] Update `src/ui.css` with cursor properties for interactive elements
- [ ] Final Verification (blocked until UI feature tickets are addressed)
  - [ ] cargo build --release
  - [ ] verify all documentation is consistent
