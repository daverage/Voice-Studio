//! Simple mode UI builders
//!
//! Provides simplified parameter controls for quick adjustments.
//! The simple mode UI is primarily built using the build_macro function
//! in the layout module, which creates the easy controls section.

// The simple mode UI is already implemented in the layout module
// This file exists to maintain the modular structure as planned
// The build_macro function in ui/layout.rs contains the simple mode UI
